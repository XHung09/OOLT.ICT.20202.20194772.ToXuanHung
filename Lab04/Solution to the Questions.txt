- Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language?
Answer: JAVA is a Pass by Value programming language.

- After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD) why does the title of these two objects still remain?
Answer: Because Java only copies the real argument in class DigitalVideoDisc to use in class TestingPassingParameter. 
	So, modifying formal arguments does not affect the real arguments which are in class DigitalVideoDisc.

- After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()) why is the title of the JungleDVD changed?
Answer: Because at this time, it calls the methods setter and getter in the class DigitalVideoDisc. 
	These methods affect directly the real argument in this class. 
	Thus, what it does is gets the title of cinderellaDVD and then use it to update the title of JungleDVD.
	Because of this, the title of JungleDVD is changed.
