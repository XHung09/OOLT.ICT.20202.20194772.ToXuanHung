2. If the passing object is not an instance of Media, it may cause run-time error. To prevent this from happening, we can pass an object of the Object class, check whether
   this object is an instance of Media or not. If true, then we can downcast it to be a Media object.

3. The method we have to implement from the Comparable interface is the compareTo() method.

5. The demo program is provided in hust.soict.globalict.test.media.MediaTest
- I separated the toString() method in two cases:
   + When toString() has not been overriden yet: In this case, the toString() method returns the string representation of the object so if I want to output this value I 
     may write, for instance, System.out.println(something.toString()). Since this statement will output the hashcode values of the objects, if I want to print out the 
     values I want I have to implement the desired output in the toString() method by overriding it.
   + When toString() has been overriden: Now, when I have overriden toString(), writing System.out.println(something.toString()) will output the values I want.

- In the previous exercises, we have to override the equals() method, which is usedin another method (contains() for example) and for the toString() method, we use it 
  directly
