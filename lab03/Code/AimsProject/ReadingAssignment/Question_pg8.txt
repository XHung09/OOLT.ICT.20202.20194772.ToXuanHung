If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build 
a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?

- Answer: 
This method is call overloading in OOP. Hence, the answer is yes, we are allowed to do this in Java.
We can call these constructor methods in anyway we want, by title or by category at a same application.
